"Man standing between a schoolbus and a building wall on North Avenue in Santacruz (West) masturbating and exposing himself. It was pretty dark between wall and bus, and there are enough bushes to hide him from the watchmen who were just about 1012 feet away. Initially it was unclear what he was up to owing to how dark it was. But when it did become more evident and I was about to call out to the watchmen he ran away. It's disturbing because there are kids living in the building and around it. This is also right on to a busy arterial lane between linking and sv road. The complete lack of fear of discovery on such a busy location is also disquieting. Just goes to show how even a seemingly highly unlikely and tiny secluded spot can become an opportunity.","[0,0,0]"
